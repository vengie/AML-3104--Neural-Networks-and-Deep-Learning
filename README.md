Anomaly Detection in Cellular network Link to Kaggle Site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/anomaly-detection-in-cellular-networks/overview The design of a cellular network focuses on the optimization of energy and resources that guarantees a smooth operation even during peak hours (i.e. periods with higher traffic load). However, this implies that cells are most of the time overprovisioned of radio resources. The goal of this study is to explore the possibilities of ML to detect abnormal behaviors in the utilization of the network that would motivate a change in the configuration of the base station.
The objective of the network optimization team is to analyze traces of past activity, which will be used to train an ML system capable of classifying samples of current activity as: • 0 (normal): current activity corresponds to normal behavior of any working day and. Therefore, no re-configuration or redistribution of resources is needed. • 1 (unusual): current activity slightly differs from the behavior usually observed for that time of the day (e.g. due to a strike, demonstration, sports event, etc.), which should trigger a reconfiguration of the base station.
